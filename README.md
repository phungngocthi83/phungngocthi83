- 👋 Hi, I’m Thi,
- 👀 I’m interested in Maths, Teaching and Coding.
- 🌱 I spent four years studying at Ho Chi Minh City University Pedagogy, where I learnt about Mathematics (Teaching-orientation) and graduated in 2018. I spent next three year (2018-2021) for studying Computational Engineering, a Master program given by Vietnamese-German University (collaped with Ruhr-Universität Bochum).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects relating Maths (and a bit Engineering).
- 📫 Reach me via email: phungngocthi83@gmail.com
